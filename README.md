Hack Truman Event 

TruOrganizer was built with the vision of being an extension to Truman's smart phone application: Trutouch. With TruOrganizer, Students can enter there Student ID and easily have access to a ready made schedule that includes there courses as well as their club hours, and professor office hours. 
With TruOrganizer, you are also able to:
- Search the schedule of other students and find their availability to coordinate meeting times (Or hide your schedule for personal use only) 
- Look up other professors and their office hours
- Be able to access the events of the clubs you participate in. 

This Program was created in 2 days for the Hack Truman Event (Truman's Hackathon) with 2 other freshman using C++ and CFML, Cold Fusion Mark-up Language, a cpp extension created to display the interface.
